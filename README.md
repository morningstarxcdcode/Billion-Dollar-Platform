## Quick Start

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd my-express-app && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Start backend
cd ../my-express-app && npm run dev

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
cd ../frontend && npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

1. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your production values
   ```

2. **Deploy with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh <version>
   ```

### Monitoring

The platform includes comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:

- **Metrics Dashboard**: http://your-domain:3001
- **Default credentials**: admin/admin

**Key Metrics**:
- Request Rate
- Response Times
- Error Rates
- System Resources

### CI/CD Pipelines

The platform uses GitHub Actions for automated deployments:

- **Staging**: Automatically deploys from the `develop` branch
- **Production**: Deploys when a version tag is pushed (e.g., v1.0.0)

### SSL Configuration

1. **Place your SSL certificates in**:
   ```
   /etc/nginx/ssl/cert.pem
   /etc/nginx/ssl/key.pem
   ```

2. **SSL is automatically enabled in production.**

### Security Features

- HTTPS enforcement
- Rate limiting
- CORS protection
- Input validation
- JWT authentication
- Security headers

### Error Handling

If you encounter issues like the following:

```
HTTPConnectionPool(host='your-domain', port=3001): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NameResolutionError("<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7fe98358a5d0>: Failed to resolve 'your-domain' ([Errno -2] Name or service not known)"))
```

- **Check your domain configuration**: Ensure that `your-domain` is correctly set up and accessible.
- **Verify network settings**: Make sure your server is reachable and that there are no firewall rules blocking access.
